For this application, I elected to make a robotic arm control system for Vibale Engineering Solutions, that integrated a
potentiometer to control the arm's pivot, and two button to create controlled, forward and backward movements.
Real-time operation for this sytem proves to carry advantage to normal control code. This is because real-time
operating systems give us the ability to enforce reliable control through deadlines, ensuring that we are able to run 
constant and consistent checks on the state of the system, and react accordingly.a
